Answer to questions
1-3
Noisy sognal is a messy and fluctuating signal so we use Moving average system to smoothen the noisy signal.
moving average filter operates by averaging a certain number of previous input samples to produce the current output sample. This averaging process introduces a delay in the output relative to the input. This is why we see delay in output.

By "Change of the variable" method we can perform moving average. so x[n-k], would be x[n-k-m1] and the range for sigma is going to be [0,m1+m2]

No. As we see, conv function produced smoother output.
